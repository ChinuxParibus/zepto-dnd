# zepto-dnd

HTML5 Drag'n'Drop API based Draggable, Droppable and Sortable for [Zepto.js](https://github.com/madrobby/zepto) (and jQuery). For Zepto, you have to include its `data` module.

```json
{ "name": "zepto-dnd",
  "version": "1.0.0" }
```

#### Why?
I often use Draggables, Droppables and Sortables. Besides jQuery UI being way too heavyweight, I want the option to use Zepto. Additionally, I (most of the times) don't care about old/bad browsers. That's the reason why I wrote these native-HTML5-Drag'n'Drop-based Draggable, Droppable and Sortable. Unfortunately, zepto-dnd reached the limits of the native HTML5 DnD API, especially in terms of dragging helper accessibility and - most important - in terms of compatiblity with touch devices. **If you are looking for a touch-compatbile DnD library, have a look at [touch-dnd](https://github.com/rkusa/touch-dnd).**
